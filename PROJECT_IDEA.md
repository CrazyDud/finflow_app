# Personal Finance App – Vision

Verbatim user idea

I want my own custom app to manage my finances/economy. I basically want EASILY to track my earnings and spendings. Control spending limits on certain categories. Warnings when nearing spending limit. Here is the catch, my monthly income varies, it’s not standard. I also want some money to be put for investment as well. Also I want my money to be split in percentages: some for monthly payments/bills/life/food etc, some for investment and the rest for fun.

Let’s have a simple and pro mode on this app (lite / max), easily togglable with a single button click. Also I have NEVER worked/built/deployed any apps myself before. I have little to no understanding about any exterior things that will be used for the project (databases, agents or whatsoever). I only know a little about how to deploy a website online (buying custom domain, hosting your project in free websites such as Vercel etc, how GitHub works (very basics)).

Polish the app design/style so it’s more fun to use, include animations/interactive elements. Make the UX optimized and easy to understand, so the user immediately understands what they are looking at and what to do next.

Refined summary

- Track income and expenses quickly with minimal friction
- Variable income support with automatic percentage‑based allocations (essentials, investments, fun)
- Per‑category monthly limits with early warnings and limit breach alerts
- Simple vs Pro mode, toggle any time; Pro unlocks advanced analytics, categories, and tools
- Clear, delightful UI with animations, undo, shortcuts, and mobile‑first UX
- Beginner‑friendly deployment and setup guidance (no prior backend knowledge required)
